# PortfolioProject4-Web-Scraper-with-Python

This project was to 

**1. Pull in the doctype html file of a product page from Amazon to Python. Extract the product's data (for example: product name, price) to an excel csv.**

**2. Create commands to auto-check this product page periodically, append future data to the same csv. (This is useful when you are interested in the product's price change.)**
